# My Personal Portfolio 

Single page application with React.js, for sharing my projects and blog (soon!)

This project had the objective of having a little practice over some of the react concepts that i've been studying the last few months. In this first version, I've used some tools and franeworks as bootstrap for some of the react components (aldought i know mixing a lot of technologies is not convenient in a project, i think is fine to use in small-scale project like this and remember some very useful tools in frontend development).
